# balanced brackets

balanced brackets algorithm example.

We say a sequence of brackets is valid if the following conditions are met:

It contains no unmatched brackets.

The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.

Examples:
 * (){}[] is valid
 * [{()}](){} is valid
 * []{() is not valid
 * [{)] is not valid
